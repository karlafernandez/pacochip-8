# What is this? #
PacoChip 8 is Multi-threaded CHIP-8 and Super Chip emulator written in C# and with very high compatibility. It's my first emulator and I made it for learning purposes. It includes most if not all the games known for these systems, plus one I made myself called LOL-HUNT.

CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by the late Joseph Weisbecker. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s. CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine. It was made to allow video games to be more easily programmed for said computers.

There are a number of classic video games ported to CHIP-8, such as Pong, Space Invaders, Tetris, and Pac-Man.

Super Chip is just an enhanced version of the CHIP-8, with more resolution and some extra features.
